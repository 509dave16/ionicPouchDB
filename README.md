# ionicPouchDB
Repository for playing with PouchDB in Ionic.

The main goal of this is to act as a test bed for a relational-pouch ORM that I am writing.

You can find the classes related to the ORM in the `classes` folder. And the `src/services/relational.service.ts` utilizes the `Database.ts` class
to seed, attach, detach resources. It's fairly comoplicated. And there are no tests at this point.
